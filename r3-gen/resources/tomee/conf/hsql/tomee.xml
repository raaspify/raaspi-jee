may24 2021 unlike wildfly (using postgres), in tomee username was changed to admin... to match creator of the tables
Also in cdi to get datasource, we need to use (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:openejb/Resource/RaaspiSQLDS")
CDI entityManager injection works ok

    #  id Postgresql but use defalt memory based HsqlDb db name mem:h or file:h, user sa null pw for quick demo, not production
    #  For production install Postgresql and use corresponding config dbname postgres,
